Dear Members of the PhD selection committee,
</p>

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to review my application for a PhD at your department. I've had the privilege to work with Professor Ludvig Löwemark over the past year and have greatly enjoyed learning from him and helping his team improve their workflow. I deeply appreciate the mentorship he has provided me, and I hope you allow me to continue the work I've been doing. The PhD would give me the framework to design and implement a larger multifaceted multiyear project. It would also allow me to continue my education in the geosciences and to gain from Professor Löwemark's extensive experience and fantastic mentorship. I feel my background in the hard sciences, industry and electronics would complement his field experience and brings a unique outside perspective and skillset to Professor Löwemark's lab and the department as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Below is my proposal for a research concept that would take several years and would build on Professor Löwemark's ongoing work in the Thailand peninsula. All ideas presented are my own unless otherwise indicated.
</p>

<h2 id="orgc477fc5">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc477fc5">
<p>
The variability of the annual Asian monsoon's intensity has been a major driver behind the change in climate in the region. These changes over the centuries have precipitated shifts in biomes, have triggered the collapse of empires and the displacement of peoples. Understanding the dynamics and evolution of monsoons is central to anticipating future trends for this region's climate. With an ever more rapidly changing climate the need to understand these systems becomes more acute. The answer to these questions lies in the climate record.
</p>

<p>
In this proposal I present a general framework for improving our understanding of the Asian monsoon's past trends based on previous research done in the area. It presents a general research trajectory, but many details and either omitted or unresolved. Tangential possibilities, like looking at other proxies, collaborations or research sites are also left implied and are omitted for brevity. The proposal is divided into semi-independent pieces which each seek to answer one piece of the puzzle that lies in the climate record. The aim of this approach is to generate fruitful intermediary results while building towards a larger more complete picture of the historical monsoon in South East Asia.
</p>

<p>
Through collaboration with Professor Löwemark I've focused the study area primarily to the caves on Southern Thailand. This both compliments Professor Löwemark's ongoing work as well as leverages his existing contacts and experience in the area. However, the choice is not simply of convenience but presents several crucial practical advantages that are unique to the Malay Peninsula.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first advantage is purely geographic; because Southern Thailand lies between the Indian ocean and the South China Sea it lies in the path of both the Summer monsoon (<b>SM</b>) and Winter monsoon (<b>WM</b>) with high precipitation coming from both systems.</li>

<li>The second advantage is that the region, famous for its beautiful karst towers, boasts a staggering amount of cave systems giving me a wide selection of candidate research locations. As we'll see, the selection of a proper cave is crucial for generating useful data. The speleothem within provide a long stable geological records that is closely tied to precipitation. The derived signals have been shown to be highly repeatable <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, highly accurate <sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> and there are fewer confounding external factors such as found in other climate records <sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. They can be dated accurately through &nbsp;<sup>230</sup>Th and the climate record can be investigated through high resolution and repeatable &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O measurements</li>

<li>I further suspect that karst towers will have much more easily characterizable dynamic when it comes to absorbing precipitation because of the limited amount of surrounding earth (and therefore due to a smaller water retention capacity will exhibit less histeresis).</li>

The first phase of the project would be a replication of the existing work done in the Hulu and Dongge caves in China by Professor Cheng Hai's team.

<p>
Their critical insight was that the Summer Monsoon, the larger of the two - driven by the heating of the Tibetan plateau, due to intense fractionation/precipitation over the Indian Ocean has a much <i>lower</i> concentrations of &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O relative to the smaller Hadley cell driven Winter monsoon <sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>(p.30). By measuring the changes in &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O in the cave that has precipitated out as carbonate/limestone on the stalagmites they managed to observe the changes in the ratio of precipitation of Summer to Winter monsoon.
</p>

<p>
We can characterize the concentration of &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>cave</sub> with:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
c<sub>cave</sub>(t) = [ P<sub>SM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>SM</sub>&times;c<sub>SM</sub> + P<sub>WM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>WM</sub>&times;c<sub>WM</sub> ] / [ P<sub>SM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>SM</sub> + P<sub>WM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>WM</sub> ]
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>c<sub>cave</sub>(t)</dt><dd>concentrations of &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O in the cave in the past</dd>
<dt>c<sub>SM|WM</sub></dt><dd>concentration of &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O in the SM|WM</dd>
<dt>P<sub>SM|WM</sub>(t)</dt><dd>Precipitation during the SM|WM</dd>
<dt>f<sub>SM|WM</sub></dt><dd>the fraction of the precipitation that goes into the cave from the SM|WM</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>



<p>
Because the Hulu cave (near Nanjing) and the Dongge cave (in Guizhou) have no major bodies of water situation North of them, the WM is mostly consists of dry Siberian air <sup><a id="fnr.3.100" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, while the SM  brings in moist air and precipitation. Since they determines that at present the Summer monsoon accounts for ~80% of the annual precipitation at both cave sites. Wang et al. present the likely culprit for decreases in the in &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O in the cave as intensification of the SM. However, Yuan et al. contend that it's primarily due to changes in the fractionation due to differences in sea surface temperatures. That said, this conclusion doesn't seem to reoccur in the literature.
</p>

<p>
All studies demonstrate a very high degree of replication between speleothems in the same cave <sup><a id="fnr.3.100" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> - so different time bands easily connect up to create very long time sequences with no gaps. Furthermore, the level of detail is so high that they no only can detect climate anomoalies like The Younger Dryas, Bolling Allerod and Heinrich Events, but they seem to even demonstrate that insolation increased 300 years before the beginning of the last Interglacial <sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
After showing a strong connection between the climate record in Greenland ice cores <sup><a id="fnr.3.100" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> they go on to show a strong connection between orbitaly induced changes in insolation and the amount of &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O <sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> <sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The first phase would be simply to replicate this study in a karst tower cave to confirm that this method would provide similar results to the ones found in China and that insolation correlates with changes in &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O.

To address the lack of dimensionality in the &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O measurements, and to resolve what's driving the changes in  &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O I propose extending the previous method to two cave

<p>
The first cave would have similar characteristics to the one in China - with predominantly SM precipitation. The second cave would be selected to predominantly get NM precipitation. The cave site should be selected in close proximity to the first in order to avoid issues caused by differences in insolation, composition, etc. Note that this may not be of significant importance: the Hulu and Dongge caves are 1200 km apart and still have almost identical &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O curves <sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. One major weakness of the Chinese experiment was the cave sites recieved almost all their precipitation from the SM <sup><a id="fnr.3.100" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. A site that gets precipitation from both monsoons would provide more information - and since the &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O values have already been shown to be incredibly reliable - I think this wouldn't induce too much noise (due to interseasonal/non-monsoon rains) into the measurements
</p>

<p>
And here the Malay peninsula has the exact conditions we are looking for. It's a rather skinny peninsula with strong WM rains on the northern-eastern shore coming from the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea,  and strong SM rains on the southern-western shore coming from the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. A low mountain range in the middle providing the necessary rain shadow effect.
</p>

<p>
For the moment we make the simplifying assumption, as before, that the monsoon isotope concentration doesn't change with time.

Rearranging the equation for the Southern Cave:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 [ P<sub>SM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,SM</sub> + P<sub>WM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,WM</sub> ] &times; c<sub>1</sub>(t) = P<sub>SM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,SM</sub>&times;c<sub>SM</sub> + P<sub>WM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,WM</sub>&times;c<sub>WM</sub> <br>
P<sub>SM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,SM</sub>&times;c<sub>1</sub>(t) - P<sub>SM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,SM</sub>&times;c<sub>SM</sub> = P<sub>WM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,WM</sub>&times;c<sub>WM</sub> - P<sub>WM</sub>(t)&times;f<sub>1,WM</sub>&times;c<sub>1</sub>(t)<br>
P<sub>SM</sub>(t) [f<sub>1,SM</sub>&times;c<sub>1</sub>(t) - f<sub>1,SM</sub>&times;c<sub>SM</sub>] = P<sub>WM</sub>(t) [f<sub>1,WM</sub>&times;c<sub>WM</sub> - f<sub>1,WM</sub>&times;c<sub>1</sub>(t)]<br>
P<sub>SM</sub>(t)/P<sub>WM</sub>(t) = [f<sub>1,WM</sub>/f<sub>1,SM</sub>]&times;[c<sub>WM</sub> - c<sub>1</sub>(t)] /  [c<sub>1</sub>(t) - c<sub>SM</sub>]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly for the Northern Cave:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
P<sub>SM</sub>(t)/P<sub>WM</sub>(t) = [f<sub>2,WM</sub>/f<sub>2,SM</sub>]&times;[c<sub>WM</sub> - c<sub>2</sub>(t)] /  [c<sub>2</sub>(t) - c<sub>SM</sub>]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can set these equal to each other and rearrange
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[f<sub>1,WM</sub>/f<sub>1,SM</sub>]&times;[c<sub>WM</sub> - c<sub>1</sub>(t)] /  [c<sub>1</sub>(t) - c<sub>SM</sub>] = [f<sub>2,WM</sub>/f<sub>2,SM</sub>]&times;[c<sub>WM</sub> - c<sub>2</sub>(t)] /  [c<sub>2</sub>(t) - c<sub>SM</sub>] <br>
[f<sub>1,WM</sub>f<sub>2,SM</sub>]/[f<sub>1,SM</sub>f<sub>2,WM</sub>] = ([c<sub>WM</sub> - c<sub>2</sub>(t)]&times;[c<sub>1</sub>(t) - c<sub>SM</sub>]) /  ([c<sub>2</sub>(t) - c<sub>SM</sub>]&times; [c<sub>WM</sub> - c<sub>1</sub>(t)] )
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The left is a constant and the right is a series of our measurements (c<sub>1</sub>(t) c<sub>2</sub>(t)) so this a simple optimization problem to solve for c<sub>WM</sub> and c<sub>SM</sub>. (This can be further simplified by taking the logarithm of both sides)

<h2 id="org5f00363">Phase 3 : Trickle Down Caveanomics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5f00363">
<p>
One thing not mentioned in the previous discussions has been the effect of the actual cave system. This is a topic of ongoing research by Professor Löwemark and complements this proposed project.
</p>

<p>
Professor Löwemark is currently investigating the response of the cave system to the intensity of rain above it. As he has theorized, several possible mechanisms could be at play:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A heavy rain above a cave system quickly saturates a certain above-ground layer on the karst tower and past a certain point rain starts to pool and pour past the cave system as surface water.</li>
<li>Light rains will quickly evaporate back into the atmosphere before having the chance to absorb into the soil</li>
</ol>


<div class="figure">
<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="./trickle-wide.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>
</div>

<p>
These mechanisms (and potentially others to be discovered) would present a complex mechanism for the precipitation to actually turn into drip water in the cave system. If these could be properly characterized as a transfer function
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
f(precipitation) &rarr; drip<sub>cave</sub>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the dynamics are not too complicated, we could then hope to build an approximate inverse transfer function 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
f<sup>-1</sup>(drip<sub>cave</sub> &rarr; precipiation
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the context of reconstructing monsoon histories, this would help add a correcting factors. At the very basic level I would expect that increases in monsoon precipitation would not linearly lead to increases in cave drip.

To further refine the results would require an in-depth meteorological study of the area. Such a study would resolve a lingering questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How does a season change in monsoon intensity translate to changes in local weather?</li>
<li>Maybe.. More intense rains (in mm/hour)?</li>
<li>Maybe.. rains of the same intensity but longer in duration?</li>
</ul>

<p>
A better understanding in conjunction with the study of the cave's precipitation-transfer-function could yield a seasonal-average-transfer function that could show how an increase in monsoon strength maps to an increase in water reaching the cave. With that data I can begin to reconstruct the true changes in monsoon/precipitation intensity
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While measuring the &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O above the cave in different seasons and in different locations should yield good reliable values for the &nbsp;<sup>18</sup>O in both the SM and WM - these values are most likely not particularly stable from one rain storm to another.
