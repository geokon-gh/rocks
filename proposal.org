Dear Members of the PhD selection committee,

Thank you for taking the time to look at my application for a PhD at your department. I've had the privelege to work with Professor Ludvig Löwemark over the past year and have greatly enjoyed learning from him and helping his team streamline their work. I deeply appreciate the mentorship he has provided me and I hope you allow me to continue the work I've been doing with him. The PhD would give me the framework to work on a larger multifaceted multiyear project. As well it would allow me continue my education in the geosciences and to profit from Professor Löwemark's extensive experience and fantastic mentorship. I also would hope that my background in the hard sciences, industry and electronics would compliment his field experience and would bring a unique outside perspective and skillset to Professor Löwemark's lab and the department as a whole.

Below is my proposal for a research concept that would take several years and would build on Professor Löwemark's ongoing work in the Thailand peninsula. All ideas presented are my own unless otherwise indicated.

* Introduction

The variablility of the annual asian monsoon's intensity has been a major driver behind the change in climate in the region. These changes over the centuries have precipitated changes in biomes, have triggered the collapse of empires and the displacement of peoples. Therefore understanding the dynamics and evolution of how monsoons is of some import when it comes to anticipating future trends for the regional climate. With a ever-quickly changing climate this need becomes more acute. The answer to these questions lies in the climate record.

In this proposal I present a general framework for improving our understanding of the asian monsoon's past trends based on previous work done in the area. It present a general research trajectory, but many details and either ommitted or unresolved. Tangential possibilities, like looking at other proxies, collaborations or research sites are also left implied and are ommitted for brevity. The proposal is divided into semi-independent pieces which trying to answer one piece of the puzzle that lies in the climate record. Simultaenously, as I hope I'm able to illustrate, they aim to build on each other and illustrate a complete picture of the historical monsoon in South East Asia.

Through collaboration with Professor Löwemark I've narrowed down the study area primarily to the caves on Southern Thailand. This both compliment his ongoing work as well as leverages his existing contacts and experience in the area. However, the choice is not simply of convenience but actually presents a couple of crucial practical advantages that are unique to the Malay Peninsula.

- The first advantage is purely geographic; because Southern Thailand lies between the Indian ocean and the South China Sea it lies in the path of both the Summer monsoon (*SM*) and Winter monsoon (*WM*) with high precipitation coming from both systems. 

- The second advantage is that the region, famous for its beautiful karst towers, boasts a staggering amount of cave systems giving me a wide selection of candidate research locations. As we'll see, the selection of a proper cave is crucial for generating useful data. The speleothem within provide a long stable geological records that is closely tied to precipitation. The derived signals have been shown to be highly repeatable [fn:Yuan2004], highly accurate [fn:Yuan2004] and there are fewer confounding external factors such as found in other climate records [fn:Wang2001]. They can be dated accurately through \nbsp{}^{230}Th and the climate record can be investigated through high resolution and repeatable \nbsp{}^{18}O measurements

- I further suspect that karst tower will have much more easily characterizable dynamic when it comes to absorbing precipitation because of the limited amount of surrounding earth (and therefore due to a smaller water retention capacity will exhibit less histeresis).

* Phase 1 : 1 Cave Replication

The first phase would be a replication of the existing work done in the Hulu and Dongge caves in China by Professor Y. J. Wang.

[[./one-cave-wide.svg]]

Their critical insight was that the Summer Monsoon, the larger of the two - driven by the heating of the Tibetan plateau, due to intense fractionation/precipitation over the Indian Ocean has a much /lower/ concentrations of \nbsp{}^{18}O_{cave} relative to the smaller Hadley cell driven Winter monsoon. By measuring the changes in \nbsp{}^{18}O_{cave} that has precipitated out as carbonate/limestone on the stalagmites in the Dongge cave they managed to observe the changes in the ratio of precipitation of Summer to Winter monsoon.

If the amount of precipitation from the SM is S_{SM} and the WM is S_{WM} then 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
\nbsp{}^{18}O_{cave} \sim S_{SM}/[S_{SM}+S_{WM}] \times{}\nbsp{}^{18}O_{SM} + S_{WM}/[S_{SM}+S_{WM}] \times{}\nbsp{}^{18}O_{WM}
#+END_QUOTE

[NEEDS MORE FORMULA MASSAGING HERE]

Because the Hulu cave (near Nanjing) and the Dongge cave (in Guizhou) have no major bodies of water situation North of them, the WM is mostly consists of dry Siberian air [fn:Wang2001], while the SM  brings in moist air and precipitation. Since they determines that at present the Summer monsoon accounts for ~80% of the annual precipitation at both cave sites (ie S_{SM}/[S_{SM}+S_{WM}] \cong{} 0.8) and \nbsp{}^{18}O_{WM} > \nbsp{}^{18}O_{SM} Wang et al. present the likely culprit for decreases in \nbsp{}^{18}O_{cave} as intensification of the SM. However, Yuan et al. contend that it's primarly due to changes in the fractionation due to differences in sea surface temperatures.

All studies demonstrate a very high degree of replication between speleothems in the same cave [fn:Wang2001] - so different time bands easily connect up to create very long time sequences with no gaps. Furthermore, the level of detail is so high that they no only can detect climate anomoalies like The Younger Dryas, Bolling Allerod and Heinrich Events, but they seem to even demonstrate that insolation increased 300 years before the beginning of the last Interglacial [fn:Yuan2004].

After showing a strong connection between the climate record in Greenland ice cores [fn:Wang2001] they then go on to show that there is strong connection between orbitaly induced changes in insolation and the amount of \nbsp{}^{18}O [fn:Yuan2004] [fn:Wang2005]

The first phase would be simply to replicate this study in a karst tower cave to confirm that this method would provide similar results to the ones found in China and that insolation correlates with changes in \nbsp{}^{18}O.

** Expected results
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
1. a very high resolution of information
2. ability to detect very small changes in climate 
3. very repeatable results with values between different stalagmites matching incredibly closely
#+END_QUOTE

** Issues
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
1. The difference in SM and WM \nbsp{}^{18}O in Thailand could be much smaller than in China
2. \nbsp{}^{18}O is a purely one dimensional proxy - and cave systems don't easily provide others.
3. An increase in \nbsp{}^{18}O can both correspond to an increase in SM precipitation or a decrease in WM precipitation. 
4. It could also be in large part due to changes in sea surface temperatures - however this could be investigated in more detail by looking at other proxies
#+END_QUOTE

* Phase 2 : A 2 Cave System
To address the lack of dimensionality in the \nbsp{}^{18}O measurements, and to resolve what's driving the changes in  \nbsp{}^{18}O I propose extending the previous method to two cave

[[./two-cave-wide.svg]]

The first cave would have similar characteristics to the one in China - with predominantly SM precipitation. The second cave would be selected to predominantly get NM precipiation. The cave site should be selected in close proximity to avoid issues due to differences in insolation, composition, etc. Note that this may not be of great importance: the Hulu and Dongge caves are 1200 km apart and still have almost identical \nbsp{}^{18}O curves [fn:Yuan2004]. One major weakness of the Chinese experiment was that the cave sites got almost all their precipitation from the SM [fn:Wang2001]. A site that gets precipitation from both monsoon would provide more information - and since the \nbsp{}^{18}O values have already been shown to be incredily reliable - I think this wouldn't induce too much noise (due to interseasonal/non-monsoon rains) into the measurements

And here the Malay peninsula has the exact conditions we are looking for. It's a rather skinny penninsula with strong WM rains on the nothern-eastern shore coming from the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea,  and strong SM rains on the southern-western shore coming from the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. An a low mountain range in the middle providing the necessary rain shadow effect.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/South Cave:/\\
\nbsp{}^{18}O_{south} \sim S_{SM}/[S_{SM}+S_{WM}] \times{}\nbsp{}^{18}O_{SM} + S_{WM}/[S_{SM}+S_{WM}] \times{}\nbsp{}^{18}O_{WM} \\
/North Cave:/\\
\nbsp{}^{18}O_{north} \sim N_{SM}/[N_{SM}+N_{WM}] \times{}\nbsp{}^{18}O_{SM} + N_{WM}/[N_{SM}+N_{WM}] \times{}\nbsp{}^{18}O_{WM}
#+END_QUOTE

While looking at \nbsp{}^{18}O values doesn't give us insight in to the unknowns: S_{SM},S_{WM},N_{SM},N_{WM}; what we can safely assume is that an increase on 2x in the SM would lead to an equal increase in the S_{SM} and N_{SM}. Mathematically speaking

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 \partial{}S_{SM}/\partial{}t( S_{SM}/[S_{SM}+S_{WM}] ) =  \partial{}N_{SM}/\partial{}t( N_{SM}/[N_{SM}+N_{WM}] ) \\
 \partial{}S_{WM}/\partial{}t( S_{WM}/[S_{SM}+S_{WM}] ) =  \partial{}N_{WM}/\partial{}t( N_{WM}/[N_{SM}+N_{WM}] )
#+END_QUOTE

\nbsp{}^{18}O_{SM} and \nbsp{}^{18}O_{WM} will have been determined from /Phase 1/'s rain studies

* Phase 3 : Trickle Down Caveanomics 

One thing not mentioned in the previous discussions has been the effect of the actual cave system. This is a topic of ongoing research by Professor Löwemark and complements this proposed project.

What Professor Löwemark is currently investigating is the response of the cave system to the intensity of rain above it. As he has theorized, several possible mechanims could be at play:
1. A heavy rain above a cave system quickly saturates a certain above-ground layer on the karst tower and past a certain point rain starts to pool and pour past the cave system as surface water.
2. Light rains will quickly evaporate back into the atmosphere before having the chance to absorb into the soil

[[./trickle-wide.svg]]

These mechanisms (and potentially others to be discovered) would present a complex mechanism for the precipiation to actually turn into drip water in the cave system. If these could be properly characterized as a transfer function
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
f(precipitation) \rightarrow{} drip_{cave}
#+END_QUOTE
then if the dynamics are not too complicated we could hope to build an approximate inverse transfer function 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
f^{-1}(drip_{cave} \rightarrow{} precipiation
#+END_QUOTE

In the context of reconstructing monsoon histories, this would help add a correcting factors. At the very basic level I would expect that increases in monsoon precipitation would not linearly lead to increases in cave drip.

** Expected result
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
1. A better understanding of how caves affect the precipitation record in speleothems
2. Could potentially allow one to recontstruct surface precipitation values
3. This completements ongoing work
#+END_QUOTE

** Issues
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
1. The effects are on the weather-scale - and they will need to be somehow extrapolated to the climate scale
#+END_QUOTE

* Phase 4 : Lets check the weather

To further refine the results would require an indepth meterological study of the area. Things to be resolved

- How does a season change in monsoon intensity translate to changes in local weather?
- Maybe.. More intense rains (in mm/hour)? 
- Maybe.. rains of the same intensity but longer in duration? 
A better understanding in conjunction with the study of the cave's precipitation-transfer-function could yeild a seasonal-average-transfer function that could tell me how an increase in monsoon strength maps to an increase in water reaching the cave. With that I can beging to reconstruct the true changes in monsoon/precipitation intensity

- While measuring the \nbsp{}^{18}O above the cave in different seasons and in different locations should yield good reliable values for the \nbsp{}^{18}O in both the SM and WM - these values are most likely not particularly stable from one rain storm to another. Looking at where the precipitation originates - both its origin and its path to the cave - could allow for a better understanding of the \nbsp{}^{18}O values for each monsoon and its variablility.

** Expected result
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- Would greatly refine the previously measured effect and value and allow the historical record to more accurately reflect the on-the-ground precipitation
- Would potentially allow both Professor Löwemark and I to eshew having to measure \nbsp{}^{18}O values on the ground as they could be reliably estimated from weather reports.
#+END_QUOTE

** Issues
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- This final phase of the project is more outside of the realm of expertise of the department and may require external collaboration.
- The difficulty of these issues is hard to gauge at this point without extensive additional research. These may be already solved or are still open problems in meterology.
